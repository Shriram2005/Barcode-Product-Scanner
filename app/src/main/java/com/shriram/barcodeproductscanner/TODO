add file permission to reed the previous files that are saved in the device

add a see all products option
    in that list, add a delete product option


when user scans a previous product code, and save it again with different name, its name should be updated

after capturing images, when i am clicking on save image, its saving the image but not redirecting to scan page. & when i am clicking on save for second time then its working.
it is only happening when the include product name settings is on.
