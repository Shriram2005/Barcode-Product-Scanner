add file permission to reed the previous files that are saved in the device



add a new functionality in this app, keeping the current functionality, explaination of the functionality is given below:

1. **Barcode Scanning**: The user scans product barcodes using the device camera (already done)
2. **Product Matching**: The application compares the scanned barcode with product codes stored in the CSV file,,add a option to import csv file in settings. this will be the structure of csv file: [_SKU_;_EAN_
00-00070425;8901207062865
00-00004752;970000004752
00-00000217;970000003761
00-00004796;4897723400660].
3.  while capture,When a match of barcode is found for the product code, name its file with product code.
4. **Image Storage**: Capture and save product photos with the following naming convention:
   - First image: `{product-code}.jpg`
   - Additional images of the same product: `{product-code}-1.jpg`, `{product-code}-2.jpg`, etc.
   - Store images in the appropriate directory
5. implement option in settings screen to switch between save barcode as image name and save product code as image name. it should work properly.
6.  this new implementation should work properly with current implementation
7. if product code naming is on and no product code is found in the csv file associated to the barcode then display message to user.

make sure that the image naming format toggle in settings work properly and images are named according to it.
