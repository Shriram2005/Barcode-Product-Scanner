# Barcode Product Scanner

## Overview
The Barcode Product Scanner is a Kotlin-based application designed to streamline the process of creating and managing product photos for online stores. Traditionally, capturing product images involves taking a photo, downloading it to a computer, renaming the file, and then uploading it to the online store. This manual process can be time-consuming and inefficient. The Barcode Product Scanner addresses this issue by automating the process, saving valuable time and effort.

## Features
- **Barcode Scanning**: Quickly scan the barcode of a product to retrieve its unique barcode number.
- **Automated Image Capturing**: Capture multiple images of the product using your device's camera.
- **Automated File Naming**: The application automatically names the captured images in the format `[barcodeNo-1]`, `[barcodeNo-2]`, etc., ensuring consistency and ease of identification.
- **Local Storage**: All images are saved in a dedicated folder on your device, making them easily accessible for upload.

## How It Works
1. **Scan the Barcode**: Use the app to scan the barcode of the product. The barcode number is retrieved and used as the base name for the images.
2. **Capture Images**: Capture multiple images of the product. The app will automatically name and save each image in the format `[barcodeNo-1]`, `[barcodeNo-2]`, etc.
3. **Save and Upload**: The images are saved in a folder on your device. You can then easily upload these properly named images to your online store, eliminating the need for manual renaming and organization.

## Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Significantly reduces the time required to prepare product images for online stores.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that all images are named consistently, making it easier to manage and upload them.
- **Convenience**: Automates the tedious process of renaming and organizing product images.

## Usage
1. Launch the Barcode Product Scanner app on your device.
2. Use the app to scan the barcode of the product.
3. Capture the desired number of images of the product.
4. The images will be saved in a folder on your device with names based on the barcode number.
5. Upload the images to your online store.
